# EDGAR Data Retrieval Module Documentation

## Overview
The EDGAR Data Retrieval Module autonomously fetches financial data from the EDGAR API based on plain English commands generated by the email reader. It extracts the necessary data for balance sheets and other financial documents, structures the data into a machine-readable format (JSON), and prepares it for insertion into an Excel file. Throughout the process, an LLM validates each step to ensure data integrity and accuracy.

## Input Specification
- **Source:** The module receives a plain English command from the email reader.
- **Example Command:**  
  *"Retrieve the latest 10-K filing for Apple Inc. (AAPL) and extract total assets, total liabilities, and net income."*
- **Required Information:**  
  - **Company Identification:** Name, ticker, or CIK.
  - **Filing Type:** (e.g., 10-K, 10-Q) and, optionally, a filing date.
  - **Financial Metrics:** Specific data points such as total assets, total liabilities, net income, etc.

## Data Retrieval Process
1. **Command Parsing:**
   - Use the LLM to parse the plain English command and extract the necessary components (company identifier, filing type/date, financial metrics).
2. **Query Construction:**
   - Map the extracted details to an EDGAR API query.
   - Construct the query to target the specific filings (e.g., latest 10-K) for the specified company.
3. **API Request:**
   - Send the constructed query to the EDGAR API.
   - Handle authentication, rate limiting, and any required headers or parameters as per the EDGAR API documentation.
4. **Response Handling:**
   - Receive and store the raw response data, which may be in XML or JSON format.
   - Forward the raw data to the parsing and formatting layer.

## Data Parsing and Formatting
1. **Data Extraction:**
   - Use appropriate parsing libraries (e.g., BeautifulSoup for XML/HTML or JSON parsers) to extract the requested financial metrics from the API response.
   - Navigate the document structure to locate key data points.
2. **Data Validation:**
   - Validate the extracted data for correctness, ensuring that numerical values, dates, and labels conform to expected formats.
   - Invoke the LLM to cross-check the extracted information against the original command requirements.
3. **Data Structuring:**
   - Organize the validated data into a clearly defined structure.
   - Prepare the data in a format that aligns with the Excel automation moduleâ€™s requirements.

## JSON Output Specification
The final output must be a machine-readable JSON object that includes all the relevant financial data. An example structure is as follows:

```json
{
  "company": "Apple Inc.",
  "ticker": "AAPL",
  "filing_type": "10-K",
  "filing_date": "2022-10-01",
  "financial_data": {
    "total_assets": "XXX",
    "total_liabilities": "XXX",
    "net_income": "XXX"
  },
  "retrieval_timestamp": "2025-02-07T12:34:56Z"
}
```

- **Fields Explanation:**
  - **company:** Name of the company.
  - **ticker:** Stock ticker or unique identifier.
  - **filing_type:** Type of filing (e.g., 10-K).
  - **filing_date:** Date of the filing.
  - **financial_data:** A nested object containing all the required financial metrics.
  - **retrieval_timestamp:** The exact time when the data was fetched.

## Integration with Excel
- The JSON output is designed to be consumed by the Excel automation module.
- Ensure that each JSON key corresponds to a specific cell or section within the Excel templates.
- The Excel module will parse this JSON and update the workbook accordingly.

## LLM Validation and Feedback
- **At Input Parsing:** The LLM validates that the plain English command contains all necessary components.
- **During Data Extraction:** The LLM verifies that the data points extracted from the EDGAR API response match the requested metrics.
- **Pre-Output Validation:** Before finalizing the JSON output, the LLM performs a consistency check, ensuring that the data is complete and correctly formatted.
- **Feedback Loop:** If discrepancies are detected, the LLM can trigger a re-query or prompt for further user clarification.

## Error Handling
- **Command Parsing Errors:** Report issues if the plain English command is ambiguous or missing key details.
- **API Errors:** Implement retry logic and error logging for scenarios such as API timeouts or invalid responses.
- **Data Parsing Errors:** If the expected data cannot be extracted, log the error and trigger a fallback mechanism (e.g., notifying the user or reattempting data retrieval).
- **Validation Failures:** If the LLM validation step fails, halt the process and report the inconsistency for manual review.

## Testing and Validation
- **Unit Tests:** Develop tests for each function responsible for parsing commands, constructing API queries, and parsing responses.
- **Integration Tests:** Simulate complete workflows using sample plain English commands and mock EDGAR API responses.
- **LLM Validation Testing:** Ensure that LLM feedback mechanisms correctly identify and address inconsistencies or errors.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Validate that the final JSON output can be successfully integrated with the Excel module.

## Configuration and Security
- **Configuration File:** Store EDGAR API endpoints, authentication credentials, and query parameters in a secure configuration file (e.g., `config/config.yaml`).
- **Security Measures:** Ensure that sensitive data (e.g., API keys) is encrypted and not hard-coded in the source files.
- **Parameter Flexibility:** Allow easy modification of query parameters, retry limits, and logging verbosity through the configuration file.

## Future Enhancements
- **Additional Data Sources:** Extend the module to support other financial data providers (e.g., Bloomberg, Refinitiv).
- **Advanced LLM Capabilities:** Enhance LLM validation for more complex commands and data relationships.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Integrate machine learning models to predict trends or fill in missing data.
- **User Feedback Integration:** Develop a user feedback loop to continuously improve command parsing and data extraction processes.

## Conclusion
The EDGAR Data Retrieval Module is a crucial component of the overall workflow, autonomously fetching and processing financial data based on plain English commands. By converting user requests into structured JSON output, this module enables seamless integration with the Excel automation system for generating accurate financial documents. Continuous LLM validation ensures data integrity throughout the process.
